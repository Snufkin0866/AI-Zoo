# Cline Rules

## Project Intelligence

This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help Cline work more effectively. It serves as a learning journal that evolves as Cline works with the project and user.

## Memory Bank Patterns

### Reading Protocol
- MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task
- Start with `projectbrief.md` and follow the hierarchy
- Pay special attention to `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for current state

### Update Triggers
- After implementing significant changes
- When discovering new project patterns
- When user requests with "update memory bank"
- When context needs clarification

### Update Process
1. Review ALL files, even if some don't require updates
2. Focus particularly on `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`
3. Document current state accurately
4. Clarify next steps

## User Preferences

### Documentation Style
- Clear, concise language
- Structured with descriptive headings
- Use of Markdown formatting for emphasis
- Mermaid diagrams for visual clarity

### Workflow
- Plan Mode: Read Memory Bank → Verify Context → Develop Strategy → Present Approach
- Act Mode: Check Memory Bank → Update Documentation → Execute Task → Document Changes

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Memory Bank Structure
- Core files follow established hierarchy
- Additional context files created as needed
- `.clinerules` captures learning and intelligence

### Documentation Focus
- Maintain comprehensive but readable documentation
- Highlight critical information
- Structure for efficient navigation
- Balance detail with clarity

## Known Challenges

### Memory Reset Impact
- Complete memory reset between sessions
- Reliance on Memory Bank for all context
- Need for comprehensive documentation

### Documentation Maintenance
- Regular updates required
- Balance between maintenance overhead and accuracy
- Need for consistent formatting and structure

## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Setup
- Established core file structure
- Defined clear file purposes
- Implemented hierarchical relationships

### Future Considerations
- Scaling with project complexity
- Optimizing reading protocol
- Measuring effectiveness
- Refining based on usage

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Documentation Tools
- Markdown for all files
- Mermaid for diagrams
- Tables for structured data
- Emphasis for critical information

### Update Workflow
- Review → Update → Test → Refine

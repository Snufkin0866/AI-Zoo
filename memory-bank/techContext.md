# Technical Context

## Technologies Used

### Documentation
- **Markdown**: Primary format for all Memory Bank files
- **Mermaid**: Diagram generation within Markdown files

### Development Environment
- **VSCode**: Primary editor for Memory Bank files
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes (if applicable)

## Development Setup
The Memory Bank requires minimal setup:
1. Create the `memory-bank/` directory in the project root
2. Create all required core files
3. Ensure Cline has read access to all files

## Technical Constraints

### File Format
- All Memory Bank files must be in Markdown format
- Files should use consistent formatting conventions
- Mermaid diagrams should be used where visual representation adds clarity

### File Organization
- Core files must follow the established hierarchy
- Additional context files should be organized logically
- File names should clearly indicate their purpose

### Update Protocol
- Files must be updated after significant changes
- All files must be reviewed when "update memory bank" is requested
- `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` require the most frequent updates

## Dependencies

### Core File Dependencies
```
projectbrief.md → [productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md] → activeContext.md → progress.md
```

Each file depends on the information in its parent files:
- `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` must align with `projectbrief.md`
- `activeContext.md` must reflect the current state based on all context files
- `progress.md` must accurately track status based on `activeContext.md`

### External Dependencies
- **Cline's Reading Protocol**: Effectiveness depends on Cline reading all files at the start of every task
- **User Updates**: System relies on regular documentation updates to maintain accuracy

## Performance Considerations
- Files should be concise enough to be quickly read but comprehensive enough to provide complete context
- Information should be structured with clear headings for efficient navigation
- Critical information should be highlighted to ensure it's not overlooked

## Security and Privacy
- Memory Bank should not contain sensitive information (credentials, personal data, etc.)
- If sensitive information is necessary for context, it should be referenced indirectly

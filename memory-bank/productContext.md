# Product Context

## Purpose
The Memory Bank system exists to solve the fundamental challenge of Cline's memory resets between sessions. It serves as a comprehensive knowledge repository that enables Cline to maintain continuity and context despite these resets.

## Problems Solved
1. **Context Loss**: Prevents the loss of critical project context between sessions
2. **Redundant Explanations**: Eliminates the need for users to repeatedly explain project details
3. **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Centralizes project knowledge in a structured format
4. **Inconsistent Understanding**: Ensures Cline maintains a consistent understanding of the project

## Functional Requirements
1. Cline must read all Memory Bank files at the start of every task
2. Documentation must be updated after implementing significant changes
3. Memory Bank must be reviewed and updated when requested with "update memory bank"
4. The .clinerules file must capture project-specific patterns and intelligence

## User Experience Goals
1. **Seamless Continuity**: Users should experience minimal disruption due to Cline's memory resets
2. **Consistent Quality**: Work quality should remain high regardless of when the last session occurred
3. **Reduced Overhead**: Users should spend less time explaining context and more time on productive work
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Cline should become more effective over time as project intelligence accumulates

## Stakeholders
1. **Users**: People working directly with Cline who benefit from continuity between sessions
2. **Cline**: The AI assistant whose effectiveness depends entirely on the Memory Bank
3. **Project Team**: Anyone involved in the project who relies on consistent understanding

## Success Metrics
1. Reduction in time spent re-explaining project context
2. Consistency in work quality across sessions
3. Accuracy of Cline's understanding after memory resets
4. Completeness of project documentation

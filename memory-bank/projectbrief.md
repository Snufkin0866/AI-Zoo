# Project Brief

## Overview
This Memory Bank serves as Cline's persistent knowledge repository. It contains all the information needed for Cline to maintain context between sessions, as Cline's memory resets completely between interactions.

## Core Requirements
1. Maintain comprehensive documentation of project state, decisions, and progress
2. Provide sufficient context for Cline to resume work effectively after memory resets
3. Structure information in a clear, hierarchical manner
4. Update documentation regularly to reflect current project status

## Goals
- Enable seamless continuity of work despite memory resets
- Minimize redundant explanations and context-setting
- Capture project patterns, preferences, and intelligence
- Maintain a single source of truth for project scope and direction

## Success Criteria
- Cline can resume work effectively after memory resets by reading the Memory Bank
- Documentation remains current and accurately reflects project state
- Memory Bank structure evolves to accommodate project complexity
- Project intelligence is captured in .clinerules for improved effectiveness

## Constraints
- All documentation must be in Markdown format
- Core files must follow the established hierarchy
- Updates must occur after significant changes or upon user request
